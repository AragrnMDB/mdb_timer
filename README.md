# mdb_timer

This is an Arduino library that implements timers so you can eliminate the delay() function.  

To use the functions in the library include the file mdb_timer.h.  

## Constructors

There are two constructors that you can use to instantiate your timer.
- mdb_timer(int resolution); Use this to specify the resolution of the timer (LOW/MILLISECONDS or HIGH/MICROSECONDS).  
- mdb_timer(); Use this to default to LOW/MILLISECONDS resolution.
